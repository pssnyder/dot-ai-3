DNA SYSTEM - THE GENETIC CODE OF LIFE 🧬
=====================================================================

Think of this as the "instruction manual" for each dot - just like how
your DNA determines if you have blue eyes or brown hair, a dot's DNA
decides if it can see far, run fast, or fight well!

KEY CONCEPT: Resource Allocation Trade-offs
Each dot has a "DNA budget" (default: 100 points). Want better vision?
You'll have fewer points for speed! This creates DIVERSITY - no single
"perfect" build exists. Some dots evolve as hunters, others as scouts,
others as reproducers.

REAL-WORLD PARALLEL:
This mirrors real biology! A cheetah evolved speed but sacrificed
strength. An elephant evolved strength but sacrificed speed. Every
organism makes genetic trade-offs based on survival needs.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Each Gene has a switch (ON/OFF) and a point value (strength)
2. Genes are grouped into Brain, Sense, and Action categories
3. Total points can't exceed the budget (enforced by validation)
4. Sexual reproduction creates offspring by mixing parent genes
=====================================================================

    GENE: The Basic Building Block of DNA 🧬
    
    A gene is like a "skill" the dot can have. Each gene has:
    - enabled: Is this skill turned ON or OFF?
    - points: How strong is this skill? (0-50 typical range)
    
    Example:
    - vision_distance: enabled=True, points=15 → Can see 15 units away
    - attack: enabled=False, points=0 → Cannot attack at all
    
    BIOLOGY LESSON:
    This mirrors real genes! You have genes for eye color that are
    either "expressed" (enabled=True) or not. The gene's "strength"
    determines how much melanin you produce (points value).

    DNA PROFILE: The Complete Genetic Blueprint 📋
    =====================================================================
    
    This is the ENTIRE genetic code for one dot - like a complete genome!
    It contains ALL possible genes organized into three categories:
    
    🧠 BRAIN GENES: Cognitive capacity (how smart the dot is)
       - memory_size: How much information can it remember?
       - sense_slots: How many different senses can it process?
       - action_slots: How many different actions can it consider?
    
    👁️ SENSE GENES: What can the dot perceive?
       - vision_distance: How far can it see?
       - vision_fov: How wide is its field of view? (degrees)
       - dot_detection: Can it sense other dots?
       - food_detection: Can it smell food?
       - dna_strength_detection: Can it identify strong vs weak opponents?
    
    💪 ACTION GENES: What can the dot DO?
       - movement_speed: How fast can it move?
       - attack: Combat damage capability
       - defend: Damage reduction when defending
       - replicate: Can it reproduce? (asexual or sexual)
    
    THE BUDGET SYSTEM:
    Each dot has a total_points budget (default: 100). Every gene with
    points > 0 COSTS those points. This creates strategic choices!
    
    Example:
    - Spend 20 points on vision → Only 80 left for other abilities
    - Spend 30 points on attack → Only 70 left for speed/senses
    
    WHY THIS MATTERS:
    This forces dots to SPECIALIZE. A dot can't be perfect at everything!
    This creates ECOLOGICAL NICHES:
    - Hunters: High attack, high vision → Find and kill prey
    - Scouts: High speed, high vision → Explore and find food
    - Tanks: High defend, moderate attack → Survive battles
    - Breeders: High replicate → Rapid population growth
    
    EVOLUTION DISCOVERS THE BEST MIX!
    We don't program which build is "best" - the simulation finds it
    through natural selection over many generations.

        SEXUAL REPRODUCTION: DNA Crossover & Genetic Mixing 💕
        =====================================================================
        
        This is the HEART of sexual reproduction! Two parents combine their
        DNA to create offspring with a MIX of both genetic codes.
        
        WHY SEXUAL REPRODUCTION?
        In nature, sexual reproduction creates GENETIC DIVERSITY:
        - Parent A: Fast runner, weak fighter
        - Parent B: Slow runner, strong fighter
        - Child: MAYBE fast AND strong! (best of both)
        - OR: Maybe slow AND weak (worst of both)
        
        This randomness is CRUCIAL for evolution:
        - Some offspring will be better than parents (breakthrough!)
        - Some will be worse (evolutionary dead-end)
        - Only the BEST survive and pass on genes
        
        THE ALGORITHM:
        1. Average the DNA budgets: child gets (100 + 120) / 2 = 110 points
        2. For each gene:
           - Enabled state: 50/50 chance from either parent
           - Points value: Average both parents ± random variation
        3. Validation: Scale down if total exceeds budget
        
        BIOLOGY LESSON:
        This mirrors real sexual reproduction! You get ~50% of genes from
        mom, ~50% from dad. But WHICH genes? Random! That's why siblings
        look different despite having the same parents.
        
        MACHINE LEARNING CONCEPT:
        This is a "genetic algorithm" - we're searching the solution space
